QT quick application for employee shift scheduling optimization


The purpose of this project is to create a employee shift synergy optimiser that allows employers to inspect at-a-glance how each employee is doing, how they interact constructively/destructively with their co-workers and how it effects the companies overall productivity.

The focus  for this project is the resturant industry, however it could easily be applied to other shift working industries (such as retail) at will.
